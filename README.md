# Vivus Styleguide

## Idea

Styleguides can be a pain to keep as a living documentation for your CSS.

By analysing the comments in your [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) files, and by adding markdown to your stylesheets, you can generate a living, breathing documentation styleguide that has examples of how the CSS is used.
